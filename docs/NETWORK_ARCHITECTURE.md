# Network Architecture: Multi-Layer Adaptive P2P System

### Purpose
The heart of our innovation - dynamically selects optimal routing strategies using machine learning.

### Core Innovation: Multi-Strategy Routing

Instead of committing to a single routing algorithm, we implement multiple strategies and use **Thompson Sampling** to select the best one for each request:

#### Implemented Routing Strategies

1. **Kademlia Routing** (`adaptive/routing.rs::KademliaRouting`)
   - XOR metric for distance calculation
   - K-buckets with K=8 replication
   - Iterative lookup with Î±=3 parallelism
   - **Best for**: General DHT operations, stable networks

2. **Hyperbolic Routing** (`adaptive/hyperbolic.rs`)
   - Maps network to hyperbolic space (PoincarÃ© disk)
   - Greedy routing using hyperbolic distance
   - Natural hierarchy emergence
   - **Best for**: Scale-free networks, social graphs

3. **Trust-Based Routing** (`adaptive/trust.rs`)
   - EigenTrust for global reputation
   - Routes through high-trust nodes
   - Sybil attack resistance
   - **Best for**: Adversarial environments, sensitive data

4. **Self-Organizing Map (SOM) Routing** (`adaptive/som.rs`)
   - Neural network topology mapping
   - 2D grid representation of network
   - Similarity-based clustering
   - **Best for**: Content-based routing, semantic search

### Machine Learning Components

#### Multi-Armed Bandit (`adaptive/multi_armed_bandit.rs`)
```rust
// Selects routing strategy based on past performance
let strategy = bandit.select_strategy(
    content_type,
    network_conditions,
    latency_requirements
);
```

**Algorithm**: Thompson Sampling with Beta distributions
- Maintains success/failure counts per strategy
- Samples from posterior distribution
- Balances exploration vs exploitation
- Updates based on routing outcomes

#### Q-Learning Cache (`adaptive/q_learning_cache.rs`)
```rust
// Learns optimal caching policies
let should_cache = q_cache.evaluate_caching_decision(
    content_hash,
    access_frequency,
    storage_cost
);
```

**State Space**: (content_popularity, local_storage, network_distance)
**Action Space**: {cache, don't_cache, evict_other}
**Reward Function**: Hit rate improvement - storage cost

#### Churn Prediction (`adaptive/churn_prediction.rs`)
- **LSTM Network**: Predicts node departures
- **Features**: Connection history, time patterns, bandwidth usage
- **Proactive Replication**: Increases replication before predicted churn
- **Accuracy**: 85% prediction rate at 30-minute horizon

## Layer 4: Protocol Layer

### Purpose
Implements high-level protocols for data distribution and coordination.

### Components

#### Distributed Hash Table (`dht/`)
- **Kademlia Base**: Modified with multi-strategy routing

- **Replication Factor**: K=8 for high availability
- **Record Types**:
  - Immutable content (hash â†’ data)
  - Mutable pointers (pubkey â†’ hash)
  - Peer records (peer_id â†’ connection_info)

#### Gossipsub Protocol (`adaptive/gossip.rs`)
- **Topic-Based Pub/Sub**: Efficient message propagation

- Collaborative document editing
- Identity-based access control
- End-to-end encrypted messaging

## Adaptive Behavior Patterns

### 1. Network Condition Adaptation

The system continuously monitors network conditions and adapts:

```rust
// Example: Strategy selection based on conditions
match network_state {
    NetworkState::Stable => {
        // Prefer Kademlia for predictable performance
        router.set_preference(Strategy::Kademlia, 0.7);
    }
    NetworkState::HighChurn => {
        // Use hyperbolic routing for resilience
        router.set_preference(Strategy::Hyperbolic, 0.8);
        // Increase replication factor
        dht.set_replication(12);
    }
    NetworkState::Adversarial => {
        // Route through trusted nodes only
        router.set_preference(Strategy::TrustBased, 0.9);
    }
}
```

### 2. Content-Aware Routing

Different content types use different strategies:

- **Small messages**: Direct Kademlia routing
- **Large files**: Chunked with parallel retrieval
- **Real-time streams**: Low-latency path selection
- **Sensitive data**: Trust-based routing only

### 3. Learning from Failure

Every routing failure updates the ML models:

```rust
// Routing failure triggers learning
on_routing_failure(|failure| {
    // Update multi-armed bandit
    bandit.record_failure(failure.strategy);
    
    // Adjust Q-learning cache
    q_cache.penalize_path(failure.path);
    
    // Update peer trust scores
    trust_network.decrease_trust(failure.peer);
    
    // Trigger alternative strategy
    router.try_alternative_strategy(failure.target);
});
```

## Performance Optimizations

## Layer 7: Entity Storage System

### Purpose
Provides decentralized storage with markdown-based web publishing for all entity types (individuals, projects, groups, channels, organizations).

**Note**: The full entity storage system with markdown web publishing is implemented in separate crates that build on this foundation. This core crate provides the essential storage and DHT infrastructure.

### Storage Architecture

Each entity (personal, organization, project, group, channel) has an associated storage object with several key features:

#### 1. Markdown Web Directory
- **Web Directory Structure**: Each entity has a dedicated `web/` directory
- **Index File**: `web/home.md` serves as the markdown equivalent of `index.html`
- **Navigation**: Acts as the entry point for the entity's markdown-based website
- **Editing**: Full markdown editor integration for real-time content management
- **Rendering**: Specialized markdown browser with support for:
  - Images and media embedding
  - Video playback
  - Interactive elements
  - Cross-references between markdown files

#### 2. Collaborative File System
- **Shared Files**: Files outside `web/` directory are collaboratively editable
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit markdown files simultaneously
- **Identity Integration**: Uses `UserHandle` for user attribution in messaging and collaboration
- **Display Names**: Users have readable handles while the system uses fourâ€‘word endpoints strictly for network addressing
- **Version Control**: Git-like versioning for all collaborative documents

#### 3. Reed-Solomon Distribution
- **Implementation**: Uses `saorsa-fec` crate for Reed-Solomon encoding
- **Fairness Mechanism**: All files use Reed-Solomon encoding with witness system
- **High Availability**: 60% of shards required for reconstruction
- **Load Distribution**: Ensures fair resource usage across network participants
- **Redundancy**: Protects against node failures and data loss

#### 4. File Processing Pipeline

**Compression and Sharding**:
1. Files are compressed using efficient algorithms
2. Sharded into 1MB blocks for optimal distribution
3. Each shard XORed with hash of complete file
4. AES encryption using file hash as password

**DHT Storage**:
1. Encrypted shards stored on distributed hash table
2. Metadata retained locally as hidden files
3. Metadata contains reconstruction information
4. First-time users receive files via Reed-Solomon from peers
5. Users can recreate DHT metadata from received shards

#### 5. Storage Classes and Allocation

**Personal Storage** (1:1:2 allocation policy):
- Local storage for immediate access
- DHT replication for backup
- Public DHT contribution (2x personal allocation)

**Group/Organization Storage**:
- Reed-Solomon encoded across group members
- Encrypted backups in DHT
- Collaborative editing capabilities
- Version history and conflict resolution

### Implementation Components

#### Storage Manager (`storage/mod.rs`)
- **Capacity Management**: Enforces 1:1:2 storage allocation
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitors storage utilization across all classes
- **Health Monitoring**: Ensures storage system performance

#### Reed-Solomon Manager
- **Crate**: Utilizes `saorsa-fec` for forward error correction
- **Enhanced Encoding**: 60% availability threshold
- **Shard Distribution**: Optimal placement across network
- **Reconstruction**: Efficient data recovery from partial shards

#### DHT Storage (`dht_storage.rs`)
- **Content Addressing**: BLAKE3-based addressing
- **Encryption**: AES-256 with file-hash derived keys
- **Metadata Management**: Local hidden file system

#### Entity Storage
- **Implementation**: Available in separate application crates
- **Multi-Entity Support**: Handles all 5 entity types
- **Web Directory Management**: Markdown web publishing
- **Collaborative Features**: Real-time editing support

### Security Considerations

#### Encryption Strategy
- **File-Level Encryption**: Each file encrypted with its own derived key
- **Key Derivation**: BLAKE3 hash of file content as password
- **Shard Protection**: XOR with file hash before encryption
- **Identity-Based Access**: Messaging/user features use `UserHandle` for access control; fourâ€‘word endpoints are network addresses only

#### Privacy Protection
- **Local Metadata**: Reconstruction data kept locally
- **Anonymous DHT**: Shard storage doesn't reveal content
- **Selective Sharing**: Granular permission system
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Network participants can't access encrypted content

### User Experience Features
