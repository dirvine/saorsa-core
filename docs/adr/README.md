# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting the key technical decisions made in the saorsa-core project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help:

- **Document rationale**: Explain *why* decisions were made, not just *what* was decided
- **Preserve institutional knowledge**: New team members can understand historical context
- **Enable informed changes**: Future modifications can consider original constraints
- **Facilitate review**: Stakeholders can evaluate decisions against requirements

## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use this template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

## Status

Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by [ADR-YYY](./ADR-YYY-title.md)

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences

### Positive
- What becomes easier?

### Negative
- What becomes more difficult?

### Neutral
- What other changes might this precipitate?

## Alternatives Considered

What other options were evaluated?

## References

- Links to relevant documentation, RFCs, papers
```

## Decision Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Under discussion, not yet approved
2. **Accepted**: Approved and implemented
3. **Deprecated**: No longer recommended, but may still exist in codebase
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision

## Contributing

When proposing changes to architecture:

1. Create a new ADR with status "Proposed"
2. Open a PR for discussion
3. Update status to "Accepted" once approved
4. If changing an existing decision, update the old ADR to "Superseded"
