## [0.5.7] - 2025-10-02

### Fixed
- **Wildcard Address Normalization for Local Connections** üåê
  - ant-quic correctly rejects wildcard addresses (`0.0.0.0`, `[::]`) as invalid remote addresses
  - Added `normalize_wildcard_to_loopback()` to convert wildcard bind addresses to loopback addresses
  - IPv6 `[::]:port` ‚Üí `::1:port` (IPv6 loopback)
  - IPv4 `0.0.0.0:port` ‚Üí `127.0.0.1:port` (IPv4 loopback)
  - Resolves "invalid remote address" errors when connecting to nodes bound to wildcard addresses

### Added
- **Address Normalization Infrastructure** üõ†Ô∏è
  - `normalize_wildcard_to_loopback()` - Transparently converts wildcard to loopback addresses
  - Comprehensive unit tests for IPv4 and IPv6 address normalization
  - Logging of address normalization for debugging

### Changed
- **P2PNode Connection Logic** üì°
  - `connect_peer()` now normalizes addresses before passing to ant-quic
  - Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 loopback connections
  - Non-wildcard addresses pass through unchanged

### Technical Details
- Fixes confusion between BIND addresses (for listening) and CONNECT addresses (for connecting)
- Wildcard addresses (`0.0.0.0`, `[::]`) are only valid for binding, not connecting
