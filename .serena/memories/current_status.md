# Saorsa Core - Current Status

## Recent Completion
The project has just completed a major milestone: **Integration of ant-quic 0.8.1 post-quantum cryptography**.

### What Was Accomplished
1. **PQC Integration**: Successfully integrated ant-quic 0.8.1's post-quantum cryptography
2. **API Exports**: All PQC types and functions are now available at the root level (`saorsa_core::`)
3. **Version Bump**: Updated from 0.3.4 to 0.3.5
4. **Published**: Successfully published saorsa-core v0.3.5 to crates.io
5. **Quality Assurance**: All compilation errors fixed, zero panics in production code

### PQC Features Now Available
- **ML-DSA-65**: NIST FIPS 204 digital signatures (1952-byte public keys, 4032-byte private keys)
- **ML-KEM-768**: NIST FIPS 203 key encapsulation (1184-byte public keys, 2400-byte private keys)
- **Hybrid Modes**: Classical + PQC, PQC-only, Classical-only
- **Default Configuration**: PQC enabled by default (not feature-gated)

### Technical Details
- **Package Size**: 356 files, 8.1MiB uncompressed (1.4MiB compressed)
- **Build Status**: Compiles cleanly with only deprecation warnings
- **API Access**: Full PQC API available at `saorsa_core::` root level
- **Testing**: All PQC functions tested and working

## Current State
- ✅ **Compilation**: Clean release build
- ✅ **Testing**: All tests passing
- ✅ **Quality**: Zero panic policy enforced
- ✅ **Publication**: Available on crates.io as v0.3.5
- ✅ **Documentation**: All public APIs documented

## Next Steps Available
The library is now ready for:
1. Application development using PQC features
2. Further development of adaptive networking features
3. Enhancement of placement system
4. Additional WebRTC over QUIC improvements

## No Pending Tasks
All requested work has been completed successfully. The post-quantum cryptography integration is fully functional and published.
