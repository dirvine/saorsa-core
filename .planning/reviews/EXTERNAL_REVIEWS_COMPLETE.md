### Key Review Findings (All Reviewers)

**Overall Consensus: Excellent Phase**
- All reviewers assigned Grade A or A- ratings
- No critical issues identified
- All quality standards met
- Foundation ready for Phase 2

### Z.AI (GLM-4.7) Assessment

**Grade: A - Excellent Phase Execution**

Strengths:
1. Rigorous measurement methodology with criterion framework
2. Clear problem identification (triple JSON encoding penalty)
3. Comprehensive documentation with visualizations
4. Bincode comparison data justifies Phase 2 approach
5. Scientific approach to baseline establishment

Recommendations:
1. Begin Phase 2: Bincode encoding migration (critical path)
2. Track improvements against Phase 1 baseline
3. Continue to Phase 3: Encryption consolidation
4. Phase 4: Transport optimization

## Next Steps

1. **Review Results**: All reviews compiled in `.planning/reviews/`
2. **Phase 1 Complete**: Ready to merge baseline measurements
3. **Phase 2 Initiation**: Begin bincode encoding migration
4. **Baseline Tracking**: Use Phase 1 metrics to measure Phase 2-4 improvements
